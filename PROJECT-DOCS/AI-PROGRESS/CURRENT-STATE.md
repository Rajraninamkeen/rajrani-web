| Project | BILOKAT — Multi-Seller Marketplace Platform |
| Canonical repo | `Rajraninamkeen/rajrani-web` (all work lives here; owner decision) |
| Remote | `origin https://github.com/Rajraninamkeen/rajrani-web.git` |
| Branch | `main` |
| Layout | `PROJECT-DOCS/` (specs + AI-PROGRESS) · `landing-page/` (frontend prototype) · backend at repo root (`src/`, `prisma/`) |
| Stack (final) | **NestJS 11.2.3 + TypeScript 5.9.3 + Prisma ORM 7.10.0** (driver adapter, prisma.config.ts) + PostgreSQL 17 |
| Current session | Session: Tech upgrade — Prisma 6→7.10 (kept NestJS 11/TS 5.9 after research) |
| Current phase | Backend modernization (Prisma 7) done; commerce feature modules remain |
| Overall status | Backend (foundation + auth/RBAC + catalog API) on Prisma 7; all verified |
| Completed sessions | 00 (audit), 01 (foundation), 02 (auth), 03 (catalog API), upgrade pass |
| Next session | Session 04 — Commerce: cart + checkout + orders |
| Active blockers | Owner to rotate GitHub token; keep `rajrani-web` canonical |
| Known technical debt | See `COMPLETION-MATRIX.md`; `src/generated/` gitignored (run `prisma generate` before build) |
| Last verification | typecheck/build OK; `npm test` 15 passing; `prisma migrate deploy` clean (5 migrations); live endpoints OK (2026-09-07) |
| Repository health | pushed to GitHub (`06bfecd`); no committed secrets |

> ## IMPORTANT PRODUCT DECISION (owner)
> **`landing-page/` is a PROTOTYPE / UX reference only — NOT an exact pixel spec.**
> It shows the *feel* of user interactions and checkout the owner wants. It is
> NOT a strict "make it exactly this." Future customer experience should be
> enriched/built properly per the PROJECT-DOCS specs and later requirements, not
> slavishly copied from the prototype. The backend/DB remains the source of truth.

## What exists vs. what the specs require

The repository today is a **documentation + prototype container**, not the final
multi-app platform.

### Present
- `PROJECT-DOCS/` — all 13 specification documents + AI-PROGRESS control files.
- `landing-page/` — a **static single-page React marketing prototype** named
  "Bilokat" (namkeen/snacks D2C). All data is hardcoded. No API / backend calls.
- Backend (`src/`, `prisma/`) — NestJS + Prisma:
  - Session 01: config, health, envelope, request-id, Identity + Catalog data
    model + 3 migrations.
  - Session 02: **Auth + RBAC foundation** — register/login/logout/me,
    refresh-token rotation + reuse detection, `user_sessions` registry,
    JwtAuthGuard + RolesGuard, `@Roles`/`@CurrentUserId` decorators.
    Auth API live under `/api/v1/auth`.
  - Session 03: **Catalog API** (public) under `/api/v1/catalog` — categories,
    product list (filters: category/bestseller/new/search/price, sort, pagination),
    product detail by id/slug. Seed populates 5 categories + 8 products mirroring
    the landing-page catalog. Product schema gained display fields
    (originalPrice, weightLabel, ratingAvg, reviewCount, pairingSuggestion,
    customerFavTag). Migration `20260907120621_product_catalog_display_fields`.

### Absent (per spec) / deferred
- No cart/checkout/order endpoints yet (Session 04+).
- No ABAC/organization/tenant isolation, step-up auth (deferred to later auth work).
- No `customer-web` full application (multi-page with account, orders, etc.).
- No `seller-web`, `catalog-publishing-web`, `support-web`, `delivery-web`,
  `finance-web`, `control-web`, `analytics-web` applications.
- No Redis-backed caching/jobs, no event bus / outbox yet.
- No payments, COD, delivery, returns, refunds, settlements, AI, analytics, or
  audit implementation.
- No integration/E2E/security tests yet (only backend unit tests exist).
- No CI/CD, no Docker runtime available in sandbox (docker-compose file is
  written; Postgres 17 + Redis used locally).

## Document priority (when specs conflict)
Per `00-MASTER-SPEC.md` §Document priority:
1. Explicit latest project decision
2. `00-MASTER-SPEC.md`
3. `01-ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. `02-BUSINESS-WORKFLOWS.md`
5. Database / API / Security specs
6. Feature-specific specs
7. Existing implementation

Existing code is **not** automatically correct.
